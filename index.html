    <p>Hi, I'm Modib Qadir. I am a computer Science student currently working towards my Masters degree. I also work as a security analyst at a biotech company in Cambridge Massachusetts.</p>
    <p>I'm passionate about cybersecurity and protecting digital systems. When I'm not analyzing security threats or studying advanced computer science concepts, I enjoy exploring new technologies and working on coding projects.</p>
    <p>This website showcases my professional journey, academic achievements, and the projects I've worked on. Feel free to explore my experience and get in touch if you'd like to connect!</p>
    <p>Currently based in the Greater Boston area, I'm always interested in new opportunities in cybersecurity, software development, and technology innovation.</p>
